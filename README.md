# Hotel Over It

Hotel Over It is a web app used to book fictional rooms at a fictional hotel. The name of the hotel was changed midway through the project from Hotel Overlook to Hotel Over It. The reason for this change was purely a joke and play on words due to the fact that the creator was simply "over it" with the project. 

## Installation

To run the front-end:
1. Clone the repo 
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. In a browser, go to `http://localhost:8080/`

To run the back-end APIs: 
1. Clone `git@github.com:turingschool-examples/overlook-api.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## Project Goals
1. Make and understand network requests to API endpoints: GET, POST, and eventually DELETE. (DELETE was not quite completed in time)
2. Use SASS to create and implement DRY css.
3. Make web app responsive and UI/UX was seamless across all screens. 
4. Ensure app was accessible by keyboard.
